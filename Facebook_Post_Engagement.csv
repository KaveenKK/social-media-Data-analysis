2. Sometimes what didn't work out for you really worked out for you
3. Life is to be lived - not controlled
4. Change is scary, but so is staying the same
5. Some people judge you for changing, other people celebrate you for growing - choose your circle wisely
6. Love yourself instead of loving the idea of other people loving you

It feels awful & overwhelming just thinking about it.
Co-parenting with the person you're healing from is hard. Especially because that person has most likely changed so much from who you once loved. It makes it even more overwhelming if:

*   he is high conflict & mean
*   if there is a new girlfriend in the picture
*   if you're going through court stuff-custody, money, etc

Stop the overwhelm by focusing on what you can control.
This will leave more emotional energy for you and your child, which is what really matters.

2. Sometimes what didn't work out for you really worked out for you
3. Life is to be lived - not controlled

5. Some people judge you for changing, other people celebrate you for growing - choose your circle wisely
6. Love yourself instead of loving the idea of other people loving you
7. Just because it's taking time doesn't mean it's not happening
8. Your whole life can change in one year, make this the one

It feels like a lot because it is.

I developed resilience knowing that difficult feelings pass with time. I'm here. The non-judgmental presence helped me feel secure in sharing and processing our feelings. It's okay to feel not okay. Normalising emotions removed feelings of guilt and self-shame. In the darkness, look for the stars. Finding positives and things to appreciate gave me reasons to carry on. I had this happen to me... Knowing that we have felt similar feelings helped me be more self-compassionate and feel understood. Focus on right now. Staying grounded in the now helped me to calm my nervous system.""

You're crying, I can see how upset you are about Dad and I separating. This shows your child you have seen them, you understand what they are feeling and you care... 2. Normalise it. It's good to let your tears out when you feel this way. This shows your child that it is okay to feel what they feel. This makes them feel safe to express their emotions around you ... 3. Empathise. It is so hard and upsetting for you that things are changing, I can see how much you're hurting. This shows your child that you not only hear and understand them, but you care about their experience ... 4. Offer help. I wonder how I can help you through this? A hug? Listen? Something else? This shows your child that you are on their team, they are not alone in this sadness and that they have your support. You've got this!

There were definitely hard times, lots of tears and I was hurting over my parents divorce ... But one of the best gifts my parents divorce gave me, was seeing my mum thrive into the person she is today, and teach me about self-care, self-love, boundaries and what healthy relationship looks like. To all of the separated Mum's out there, remember that your strength and the lessons you teach your children through your divorce, can far outweigh the negatives! Keep going! You've got this!

It feels awful & overwhelming just thinking about it.
Co-parenting with the person you're healing from is hard. Especially because that person has most likely changed so much from who you once loved. It makes it even more overwhelming if:

*   he is high conflict & mean
*   if there is a new girlfriend in the picture
*   if you're going through court stuff-custody, money, etc

Stop the overwhelm by focusing on what you can control.
This will leave more emotional energy for you and your child, which is what really matters.

You're crying, I can see how upset you are about Dad and I separating. This shows your child you have seen them, you understand what they are feeling and you care... 2. Normalise it. It's good to let your tears out when you feel this way. This shows your child that it is okay to feel what they feel. This makes them feel safe to express their emotions around you ... 3. Empathise. It is so hard and upsetting for you that things are changing, I can see how much you're hurting. This shows your child that you not only hear and understand them, but you care about their experience ... 4. Offer help. I wonder how I can help you through this? A hug? Listen? Something else? This shows your child that you are on their team, they are not alone in this sadness and that they have your support. You've got this!

Suddenly it felt like everything changed...nothing was certain… My Mum tried to cheer me up and make me feel better, but nothing worked. I always felt anxious.
Until this happened: One day my Mum had a chat with me about what was important in my life.
She said she could see that so much of what was important in my life had changed... She asked me how we could create certainty around things that I didn't want to change ... and then something amazing happened! ... We made routines together that created certainty around the things that mattered in my world. Like having structure around when I saw both my parents and making sure I had all my favourite things in the right home at the right time ... From that moment on, everything changed for me. I wasn't consumed by anxiety and could focus on the things that made me happy. I don't know how my Mum knew I needed this but it made all the difference!"" ""Our children need to know we value the things that are important to them, and that we can work together to create structure around these things, so they have certainty around them... Leaving them free of anxiety, so they can enjoy their childhood.""

So how do you do it? how do you get it right!? 
The answer lies in a crucial understanding that can make all the difference in ensuring your child feels secure, loved, and supported through this challenging time. 

And that is the Power of Differentiating Love. 
This means your child understanding that your love/attachment to them is different to your love/attachment to their other parent, and how even though your romantic love changed, your love for them as your child, never can or will.

1. Life is too short to let loneliness drive you back to toxic people
2. Sometimes what didn't work out for you really worked out for you
3. Life is to be lived - not controlled
4. Change is scary, but so is staying the same
5. Some people judge you for changing, other people celebrate you for growing - choose your circle wisely
6. Love yourself instead of loving the idea of other people loving you
7. Just because it's taking time doesn't mean it's not happening
8. Your whole life can change in one year, make this the one

108778868994125_122162946854027157,2024-03-18,"Guidance from a therapist on how to speak to your child about your divorce. When discussing your divorce or responding to your child's questions, it's essential to emphasise that their attachment to you is different from the attachment between you and their other parent.
Why does this matter?
Children see their two attachment figures (let’s say mum and dad), becoming unattached when love ‘breaks’ between them. This can trigger subconscious anxiety about the stability of their own attachment to you. You can alleviate this anxiety by explaining the nuances of different types of love and reassuring your child that your love for them will always be there, never changing.
But how do you actually explain this to a child in a way they understand I hear you ask!?

One way to do this: Ensuring your child feels meaningfully connected to a wider group of people, this might be family friends, aunts, uncles, grandparents.

Here is what you need to do.
1. Identify Key People: Figure out who holds importance in your child's world outside of you and their other parent.
2. Quality Time: Prioritise and organise quality time for your child to spend with these significant people. 
3. Provide Structure: Create certainty for your child, by clearly explaining when your child will see these people and what activities they'll engage in. A visual aid like a wall calendar can work wonders!

To begin with I didn't, I felt overwhlemed by anxiety and worry.
As a therapist I knew an anxious mum equalled anxious kids, so I had to take control.
The first thing I did was create a guide using all my knowledge as a therapist and practically put these things in place to support my kids, even when I was feeling overwhelmed.
And now I want to share this guide with you for free. I so wish I had this at the beginning.

One way is to allow them to have some control over the changes that are happening.
they can't control what changes.
but they can have some control over how things change for them.

Here is an example.
You have to move house (they can't control this), but what colour would they like their new room (they can control this). Giving small areas of control in a way that means something to them, WILL help them to thrive!

It makes it even more overwhelming if:
*   he is high conflict & mean
*   if there is a new girlfriend in the picture
*   if you're going through court stuff-custody, money, etc

This is not because they're blind to your shortcomings but because they so clearly see your soul.

There is so much loss when we separated from our child’s other parents. A loss of what we dreamt the relationship would be, a loss of the family unit we imagined and wanted for our children, a loss of time with our children if we are coparenting. IT IS TOUGH!…but no one talks about it, and we have to pick ourselves up and put a brave face on for the kids while we are hurting so much ourselves.

This year I don't have my children on Christmas Day, which always fills me with sadness 💔😢. I find ways to enjoy myself, but I can't deny the sense of loss and loneliness in not having them with me during such a magical and exciting day for them.

Instead of celebrating on Christmas Day, we will be having a little celebration on Boxing Day, where they will open their presents with me and see my family.

Make sure you have people who are able to hear you, understand you and support you through your divorce, co-parenting and being a mum. 

So often, when we feel full of anxiety and mum-guilt, we want to curl up in a ball and shut out the world. Try and fight against this urge and make sure you are reaching out to at least one close person who can support you through this. Therapy is also so important throughout this stage in life.

I know sometimes it doesn’t feel like it, but you have got this! It will get easier and it’s going to be okay - take it from someone who has been in your shoes.

When you feel you are in the middle of a storm you cannot control, don’t try and calm the storm (because you can’t, it’s out of your control), calm yourself (because you are the only thing in your control), and step forward in pride and power, being the person that you want to be for you and your children. 💪💖

They will tell you ‘will you play with me' or follow you around the home.

Here's what you need to remember in this situation:
1. Holding your boundary is okay and is actually good for your child (this provides certainty for them around what is okay at your house)
2. Feeling guilty, worried, annoyed in this situation is normal and natural -- Breath and remember your child is just testing the boundaries (which is normal)
3. Make sure your rules and boundaries in your home align with your values as a parent, don't feel pressured to bend to anything outside of this

By creating space for them to express feelings other than happiness with you, you are creating a foundation of trust between you and them, and a relationship where they feel held through whatever they need or feel. This is what creates life-long happiness and mental well-being for children.
