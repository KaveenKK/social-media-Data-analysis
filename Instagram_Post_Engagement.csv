1. Life is too short to let loneliness drive you back to toxic people
2. Sometimes what didn't work out for you really worked out for you
3. Life is to be lived - not controlled
4. Change is scary, but so is staying the same
5. Some people judge you for changing, other people celebrate you for growing - choose your circle wisely
6. Love yourself instead of loving the idea of other people loving you
7. Just because it's taking time doesn't mean it's not happening
8. Get yourself the support you need to ensure your children thrive. I am running a free masterclass to give you the tools you need.

I am a therapist and a divorced Mum of 2, and this is what I say to repair with my children... I am sorry for speaking in a cross voice. I have my own big feelings and they came out in a cross voice. I am sure that felt scary and sad for you. It's not your fault. I love you so much. Remember: Good mums don't get it right all the time... Good mums repair!""

It's ok to say to your child...
â€˜I hear you donâ€™t want to go to Dadâ€™s house, sometimes we do what we want to do & sometimes we do what we have to do. This, right now, is something we have to do.
It might feel hard, I know.
I also know you can do it & that you'll be ok'

It gets easier and this is not your story, it is just part of your story.
